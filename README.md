# Hades II Nuzlocke

Hades II Nuzlocke is a mod that spices up your [Hades II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/) runs with additional challenges, taking inspiration from the _Nuzlocke_ ruleset popular in the Pok√©mon game franchise. 

Please note that the mod is current unfinished and may cause unexpected crashes. Additionally, due to the game still being in Early Access any future updates or patches may crash the game so it is recommended to backup your save files before installing the mod. You can find your save files under ``C:/Users/<User>/Saved Games/Hades II``(For Windows) as ``ProfileX.sav`` where ``X`` is the profile number of your current save (1-4).

### NOTE: Please disable the _Transmit Data_ setting in the settings menu while using this mod. Supergiant Games uses this data to balance and finetune future updates and this mod can make the data noisy for the developers.

## Ruleset

- You can only obtain boons via a God's keepsake, in a miniboss encounter or in Charon's shop.
- You can obtain boons from only one God per region.
- Whenever you defeat a region's boss, you have to choose a core slot (Attack/Special/Cast/Sprint/Magick Gain). If you have a boon equipped in that slot, it is discarded and for the rest of the run you cannot equip a boon in that particular slot.
- Whenever you use a Death Defiance, a random God and all of their boons will be removed. The God will be removed from the God pool for that run.

## Additional Features

- Adds new items to the Well of Charon:
  - **Placeholder_Item_Name**: The next time you lose a Death Defiance, you can choose which God's boons you wish to discard.
  - **Placeholder_Item_Name**: The next time you lose a Death Defiance, you negate the effect of losing your boons.

## Installation

- The mod will initially be released on Thunderstore with potential ModImporter support with enough demand. To install the mod via Thunderstore, you will need to manually install the dependencies or use the fork for R2Modman [here](https://github.com/xiaoxiao921/r2modmanPlus/releases).
